Assignment 1: Marks Processing

This module provides utility functions to process a list of student marks.

Functions implemented in list_utils.py:
1. get_top_n_marks(marks, n) - Returns the top n highest marks without modifying the original list.
2. count_mark_occurrence(marks, value) - Counts how many times a given mark appears in the list.
3. get_high_scorers(marks, threshold) - Returns marks greater than or equal to the threshold using list comprehension.

Testing:
- test_list_utils.py imports the functions.
- Creates a sample marks list.
- Calls each function and prints results.
- Verifies that the original list remains unchanged when required.

Learning Objectives:
- Sorting and slicing lists.
- Counting occurrences.
- Using list comprehension.
- Writing modular, importable Python code.
